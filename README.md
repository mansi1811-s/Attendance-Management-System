# Attendance-Management-System
This Attendance Management  System is designed and implemented in such a way that taking student’s attendance in a class is done in a more effective way.
The main aim of this project is to provide a platform for managing attendance of students and generate reports. The faculty will be able to mark student’s attendance on the basis of their presence in the class. Also faculty can log in to the system by providing valid username and password. Attendance is calculated at the end of each day and also the reports are generated at the end of each month.
 The history and attendance details of both students and faculty can be maintained .The system is based on inserting, deleting, searching and updating of database management system
